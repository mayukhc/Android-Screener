## Download

The apk on the Releases page is updated manually and will not be synchronized with the latest updates, and the program is not yet complete enough to be “released”!

So it's best to download the apk from the [Actions](https://github.com/jiesou/Android-Screener/actions) page first, if the artifacts in Github Actions is expired and cannot be downloaded, you can *fork* this project and rebuild it.
